**A website I had brought onto the project reel in 2017, soon after leaving school.**

I was not prepared for this extensive of a project, but learning the platform was worth it.
I'm glad I took it on in the end, because it taught me the value of my own work.

The site was originally being built as a unversal platform for landlords and owners alike
Featured several validated forms, a user portal, free downloadable forms, and some other nifty features.

The user portal was the most extensive by far
It encompassed leases, renewals, renovations, and anything else that would be needed for a property owner that was renting.

I still look at this project from time to time and think back on the task.
CakePHP.... Never again.
