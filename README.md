**A website I had brought onto the project reel in 2017, soon after leaving school.**

I was not prepared for this extensive of a project, but learning the platform was worth it.
*I'm glad I took it on in the end, because it taught me the value of my own work.*

The site was originally being built as a unversal platform for landlords and owners alike
1. Featured several validated forms
2. A user portal, free downloadable forms
3. Some other nifty features.

The user portal was the most extensive by far
It encompassed:
1. Leases
2. Renewals
3. Renovations
4. Anything else that would be needed for a property owner that was renting.

I still look at this project from time to time and think back on the task.
**CakePHP.... Never again.**
